This one is just an exercise to test SWAPI API

## USAGE
You can get some informations about "Star War's movies" and its planets,
so try to click on all buttons to get data and to reversing data.

#
If you want you can insert a date in the input field to see if there are some planets 
created in that particular date.

N.B. the only dates available are 9th december 2014 and 10th december 2014
all others dates return no results.
